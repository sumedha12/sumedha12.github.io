  <p align="center"><b>I plan to make a job review site giving the feedback of all the IT companies. The feedback will be collected from
  employers working in the companies. It would help the new employers to come across and read the reviews. They can in turn also give there 
  own feedback. The reviews will be on the basis of parameters like GROWTH,LEARNING, SALARY INCREMENTS,WORK ENVIRONMENT,HIGHER MANAGEMENT. 
  I want to keep the focus of my site restricted to only IT companies</b></p><br><br>
  <p align="center"><b>WORK DONE:</b></p>
  <p align="center"><b>I have designed three pages. The first one allows you to SEARCH by a particular company, Search By Roles and Search By Salary.
  This will be the home page of my website.</b><br><br>

<p align="center"><b> I also researched and found list of some companies. I then created a plug in to create a suggestion-box for the users.This  was developed using AJAX and Jquery</b><br>

<p align="center"><b>The next step was to show the user data once he/she selects any of the company. For this purpose I created a plug-in that extracted all the 1st paragraphs of various companies from pages in wikipedia. So once a user selects a company from previous page he/she is directed to information about the company. </b><br>

<p align="center"><b>Finally I created the theme of the review page which should look like this. So after viewing the information of the company user is redirected to the review page in which he can give ratings of various companies to the user. </b>
