  <p align="center"><b>I plan to make a job review site giving the feedback of all the IT companies. The feedback will be collected from
  employers working in the companies. It would help the new employers to come across and read the reviews. They can in turn also give there 
  own feedback. The reviews will be on the basis of parameters like GROWTH,LEARNING, SALARY INCREMENTS,WORK ENVIRONMENT,HIGHER MANAGEMENT. 
  I want to keep the focus of my site restricted to only IT companies</b></p><br><br>
  <p align="center"><b>WORK DONE:</b></p>
  <p align="center"><b>I have designed three pages. The first one allows you to SEARCH by a particular company, Search By Roles and Search By Salary.
  This will be the home page of my website.</b><br><br>

<p align="center"><b>The next step was to create a plug in for extracting the text(1st paras) of various companies from wikipedia.
